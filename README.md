issue-graph
===========

A graphical view of the relationships between github issues 

---

GitHub is awesome for tracking issues related to repositories. It even lets you easily reference issues across repos. But once you've grown to many repos, it can become very hard to see the overall map of dependencies between issues across projects. This Issue-Graph application will make it possible to see at a glance how issues are related throughout an organization's or user's repos.

Starting an internship earlier this year at [MarkITx](https://www.markitx.com/) I was given this basically premise and tasked with implementing it and making it my own.  Though not nearly finished, I do believe it is ready to receive outside suggestions.  I just finished my first year at the University of Chicago and this is my first major dev project so I welcome any constructive recommendations.

My vision for this application is to become a tool to visualize the workflow and goals of an organization through their company repos and issues.  An employee of a company would be able to visually identify each issues dependencies, specifically which issues are heavily connected to the closing of other issues.
