issue-graph
===========

A graphical view of the relationships between github issues 

---

GitHub is awesome for tracking issues related to repositories. It even lets you easily reference issues across repos. But once you've grown to many repos, it can become very hard to see the overall map of dependencies between issues across projects. Issue-Graph will make it possible to see at a glance how issues are related throughout an organization's repos (or even across organizations).
